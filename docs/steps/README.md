# Tutorial steps – expand each step here

Each step is a **building block** with its own doc. Follow the [documentation model](../PLAN.md#6-documentation-model-tutorial-per-step-article-ready) in the main plan: Goal, Options considered, Choice and why, Tools, Example, Line/block-level why, Diagrams, Relevant links, Building block.

**Order:** We build progressively (e.g. one Button end-to-end). Complete steps in sequence; each step feeds the next. The [Dev step plan (iterations 0 to n)](../PLAN.md#12-dev-step-plan-iterations-0-to-n) maps each **iteration** to the steps to enrich and the solution to deliver—use it to iterate one thing at a time.
